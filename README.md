# MyPhotos

This is my submission for the Eulerity 48-hour take-home coding challenge. The objective of this app is 1) to display a list of images, 2) to allow editing of those images, and 3) to save these edited images.


## App Walkthrough GIF

Note: the yellow tint on the UI elements is a simulator bug!
Here is a GIF demo of the app:
